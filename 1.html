    <p><u>Deep, One of my favorite moods which is related to Chic.</u><br>
   For example, this style will be career men and women looks.<br>
   The key colors of this moods contains Deep blue, Deep green, Deep pink, Wine, Plum and sometime Black.</p>
   <p>This mood cocus on the Chic, I will develop this mood like clear, mature, and not loud.<br>
It's not only cool but also, soft.<br>
I don't think the night and winter are always cool, they are somethimes warm.<br>
And that doesn't only mean about the temperature, it maens the moods, feelings and thinkings</p>
