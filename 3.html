    <p><u>Fancy, Another my Favorite Mood.</u><br>
   I think, it's related to the sencond mood. But I need to think about this mood more.
   Now I am thinking that mix this mood with Fancy like animal prints and every my favorite fancy patterns.
   But originally I thought that this mood related to more "being"-No gender, No stereotype, No appearance and so on.
   However, I need to consider how I indicate this mood and what I indicate it with. So, let me think about it and will update it step by step.
